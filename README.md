Tiny app to translate War Thunder telemetry to telemetry in a format that MOZA Cockpit uses for DCS.

To make it work DCS must be configured in the MOZA cockpit, doesn't mean you have to install it, you can point it to empty directories and it should be fine.
Rename the bridge executable to `DCS.exe` and run it, without DCS.exe running Cockpit won't connect to it.
